Explain how the company will make money.*

The company will make money by charging companies for advertising new positions, placing candidates, and generally providing tools to manage the recruitment process end to end. Exactly *how* we will charge will largely depend on our ability to measure success through the process. For example, if we can come up with a way to track hires, one of the models would be to only charge upon successfully hiring a candidate.
